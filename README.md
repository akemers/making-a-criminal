# making-a-criminal
This interactive website is an exploration of the criminalization of illegal immigrants in New Orleans using the criminal reentry charge. New Orleans is a mirror of a national trend but also a hotspot for this enforcement tactic. We begin with a morning like any other. Jose Isaias Lara-Serrano got out of bed, made coffee, and got on the road to work as a day laborer.
